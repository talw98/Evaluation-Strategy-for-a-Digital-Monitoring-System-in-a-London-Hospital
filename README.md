# Evaluation-Strategy-for-a-Digital-Monitoring-System-in-a-London-Hospital
This is a peer graded assignment for Imperial College London's Coursera course titled 'Evaluation of Digital Health Interventions', a part of their 'Digital Health' specialisation. The task was to develop an evaluation strategy for a digital sepsis monitoring tool in a London hospital.
The evaluation strategy needs to cover three broad areas which are:
1.     How the effectiveness and feasibility of this system in this hospital setting would be assessed through the development of an evaluation strategy. 

2.     What the challenges might be?

3.     How these challenges might be overcome?
